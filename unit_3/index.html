	<p>Heroes for every generation</p>

	<p>Saints in Seven seeks to inspire Catholic youth to live out their Confirmation anointing. With short seven minute videos on the lives of the saints, we remind today's youth that devotion to the sacraments and love for Jesus Christ can make the ordinary person rise to extraordinary holiness and change the world around them.</p>
