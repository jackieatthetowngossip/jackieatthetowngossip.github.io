	<p>Saints in Seven is a non-for profit film production company that seeks to inspire Catholic youth to live out their Confirmation anointing. With full length biographies and short seven minute videos on the lives of the saints, we remind today's youth that devotion to the sacraments and love for Jesus Christ can make the ordinary person rise to extraordinary holiness and change the world around them.</p>

			<h2>We inspire heroes for a time such as this</h2>

			<div id="children">
			<p>Our children are growing up in a caotic and confusting world. Everyone is connected, yet lonelier than ever. They are bombarded by input, influencers, posts, and texts. What is real?  What is illusion? What is life about and is there anything worth living for? </p>
			</div> 
	
			<div id="more">

			<p>More than ever, kids need real heroes not computer or movie avatars. Uncommon human beings that have discovered the secret to true happiness is worth suffering and sometimes even dying for. Role models for today's generation that witness to the freedom found in the truth of Christ. </p>
